    <h1>My Personal Portfolio</h1>
    <p>My first project I would like to show off is my Midterm. I feel proud to say that my learning came together over the course of a week to produce this finished work.</p>

    <p>Another project of mine I am proud of is the CarLot Lab, it uses a lot of the principles I used in my midterm like objects, making a pseudo databse, and lists.</p>

    <p>My last project I would like to show is probably the first one I really struggled with but was able to push past the struggle and make a working Blockbuster app.</p>
